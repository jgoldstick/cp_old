<h3>HOW YOU CAN COMMUNICATE TO IMPROVE YOUR CHILD'S CIVIL AND APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR
FIVE STRATEGIES
</h3>
<p>The following are ways to help your child improve his civil and appropriate behavior</p>
<ol>
<li>The goal is for your child to communicate in civil and socially acceptable ways.</li>
<li>Start with the strategies below that come most easily for you.</li>
<li>Try one or two as you play with your child, then watch how he responds.</li>
<li>Keep doing the ones that work with your child.</li>
<li>If certain ones seem uncomfortable, do not push yourself. There are many different ways to be effective.</li>
<li>Try new strategies when little is happening with your child.</li>
<li>Determine success by what results in less negative and more positive behaviors.</li>
<li>The goal is for your child to treat others with respect and appreciation.</li>
<li>Be patient and feel energized by each new positive behavior.  However small it seems, it is important for your child. </li>
</ol>
<h3>RESPOND</h3>
<ol><li>Talk to behaviors you want more of.</li>
<li>Do not talk to behaviors you want less of.</li>
<li>Regularly ask yourself: Do I want this behavior to continue?</li>
<li>Look away when your child is doing something you want to decrease.</li>
<li>Do not talk to your child when taking him to time-out.</li>
<li>Remind yourself that your attention is like a fertilizer to your child.</li>
<li>Teach your child's partners to attend to the positive and ignore the negative.</li>
</ol>

<h3>MATCH</h3>
<ol>
<li>The more you act like your child the more he will cooperate.</li><li>
The more you talk in ways your child can try, the more he will respond.</li><li>
Evaluate your child's environments for over stimulation.</li><li>
Understand and reduce environments that disrupt your child.</li><li>
Understand and increase environments where your child behaves well.</li><li>
Define "good behavior" as positive interactions, not only as "not doing anything 
wrong".</li><li>
Change your child's environments so he interacts more positively.</li><li>
Be sure to give your child tasks he can succeed with.</li><li>
Try doing only one thing at a time when playing with your child.</li>
</ol>
<h3>BALANCE</h3>
<ol><li>
Avoid doing much more than your child in an interaction.</li><li>
Wait for your child to take a turn.</li><li>
Wait silently and with clear expectation for him to respond.</li><li>
Gently insist on taking your turn</li><li>
Be sure neither of you dominates the interaction</li><li>
Explain the '50/50' rule: when interacting, try hard to do no more than half of the     
talking.</li><li>
Think of communicating as more a 'give and take' than just giving information or 
directions.</li><li>
Be sure your 'turn' responds to what the child just said or did.</li><li>
When the child dominates the interaction, silently terminate it briefly; do not support 
       excessive behavior that will limit him in society.</li></ol>
<h3>SHARE CONTROL</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Allow child to control your interactions at least half the time.</li><li>
Follow child's ideas and actions at least half the time.</li><li>
Be more responsive than directive; that is respond supportively more than controlling in 
       a directive way.</li><li>
Limit your questions to necessary ones and less than 20%of your talk.</li><li>
Make sure that he allows you to have some control.</li><li>
Comment frequently on what your child does or says, then wait for a response.</li><li>
Make your interactions more a playful flow than a task.</li><li>
Avoid pressing your child for specific answers more than 20% of the time.</li><li>
Teach the child by example that he can have successes in conversation.</li></ol>

<h3>BE EMOTIONALLY PLAYFUL</h3>
<ol>
<li>Genuinely enter into your child's activities of interest.</li>
<li>
Play with child when he is acting positive.</li>
<li>
Comfort child when he is genuinely fearful.</li>
<li>
Make sure to discipline quietly and quickly.</li>
<li>
Learn to read your child's emotions.</li>
<li>
Show him that you genuinely enjoy him.</li>
<li>
Learn to "read" when he is available.</li>
<li>
Build on his "available" times by joining him in them.</li><li>
Respond to the positive things your child does.</li><li>
Ignore the undesired things your child does.</li><li>
Avoid judging your child's behavior.</li><li>
Invite child into activities you enjoy.</li><li>
Understand your child's fears and limitation.</li><li>
Reduce stress in your interactions.</li><li>
Be more concerned with the interaction continuing than "right" answers.</li><li>
Tolerate your child's play even when you do not understand it.</li><li>
Be animated and more interesting than your child's distractions.</li><li>
Comfort child when he is distressed.</li><li>
Show child clear boundaries to abusive behavior.</li></ol>
