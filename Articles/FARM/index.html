<h2>THE ARM
THE ADULT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP MAP</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Follow your child's social and communication development from early play through civil conversations.
</p><p>
The ARM is the central tool of the Communicating Partners programs (formerly "ECO") it is for parents and professionals to help children socialize and communicate more effectively.  The ARM measures a child's current signature strengths and changes over time, identifies the child's next developmental steps, and provides adults with guides for interacting in ways that will help the child socialize and communicate.  
</p><p>
	There are five developmental forms to the ARM. Each form relates to a different stage of communication development. The five stages are:
	<ol>
	<li>Interactive Life,</li>
	<li>Nonverbal Communicative Life,</li>
	<li>Social Language Life,</li>
	<li>Conversation Life, and</li>
	<li>Civil and Emotional life.</li>
	</ol>

</p><p>	Each form has a Child guide and an Adult or Partner guide.  The Child guide informs you where your child is now developing in terms of signature strengths, what he or she needs to do next and how he or she is changing over time.

</p><p>	The Adult-Partner guide shows how to interact and communicate with a child so that he or she becomes more social and communicative.  The Adult guide shows how to use the following five proven strategies to help a child develop in each stage.

1.	Sensitive Responding,     2.  Balancing,
3.  Matching,    4.  Sharing Control, 5.    Be Emotionally Playful
</p><p>
The "Environment" guide identifies potential  barriers to your child's communication and directs you to consider changes that may allow him to  socialize and communicate more.
</p><p>
The ARM is based on 30 years of research with over 1000 children, parents and educators.  The ARM can be used with the books Communicate with Your Child  (2002) and Communicating Partners (2004).  For details and more programs, see the website: www.jamesdmacdonald.org

CONVERSATION
What does your child need to become a conversationalist?
</p><p>
Based on years of developing conversations with children, we have found certain skills that help children become effective and enjoyable conversation partners.  Many children with delays have language but do not effectively use it in conversations. Conversation, not language alone, is the key to successful relationships, learning and success in society. The skills below allow a child to build a conversational life.
</p><p>
Four general attitudes seem essential to become a conversationalist:
1. Interest in sharing his knowledge
2. Interest in what others have to say
3. Understanding that conversations have many purposes
4. Confidence and enjoyment in interactions. 
</p><p>
With these four attitudes, your child will become a successful conversationalist to the degree they develop the following skills.
</p><p>
