I thought it might be useful to send you some
ideas on the question of How does the Communicating Partners approach differ
from other approaches to language delayed children. I feel the more you
understand what we are trying to do and the principles we follow, the
easier it will be to grow with us....Thank you ,Jim</p>


<p> Many parents face a confusing dilemma with their
child-whether to change him to act 'normal' or to accept him and help him
develop as the best unique person he can be. In 30 years we have found that
children become much more social and communicative when parents play an
active part in helping the child develop his unique strengths rather than in
changing his basic nature. The discussion below highlights some of the
differences between the communicating partners approach that views the child
as developing signature strengths and needing to become social and
communicative first and traditional approaches that focus on making the
child a compliant student first.
</p>

<h3>THE ISSUE OF CURE VS. DEVELOPMENT</h3>
<p>
Parents understandably are driven to "cure" as many of their child's
ailments as possible. They treat a cold, fix a broken leg and teach
children to solve problems. Consequently, it is reasonable when faced with
autism, they are immediately drawn to "fix' it or to seek a cure. This urge
is natural and well intentioned. The problem with focusing on "curing" the
"problem" is that it may lead to throwing the baby out with the bath water.
What I mean is that, when we try to stop a child from being autistic or
acting in his own ways, we are often discouraging the abilities and
interests every child has. Parents looking for a cure for autism often
think they need to wait until the child is "normal" before having a "real"
relationship with him. In so doing, they miss many critical opportunities
to relate in ways that help him develop.
</p><p>
Communicating Partners takes the approach of positive psychology (Seligman,
2001) by addressing the child's "signature " strengths rather than his
weaknesses. The goal is social development not cure. And the starting point
is how the child is currently developing. This approach supports the child's
interests and key abilities, so that he will develop more positively and
less negatively. We see each child as having some "signature" strengths can
be built upon to form durable relationships. We are convinced that almost
every child with autism or other delays can develop authentic relationships
and that his total development depends on those relationships. While we
have seen many persons, diagnosed with "autistic or pdd", become persons who
no longer fit the diagnosis, our goal is not a cure. Rather our goal is to
help children develop as many social relationships as they can.
Consequently, an enduring goal of our approach is to help the child use
his current strengths in becoming social and communicative.
</p>
 <h3>2. VIEWS OF which comes first: STUDENT OR SOCIAL PARTNER</h3>
<p>Traditional education and Communicating Partners differ fundamentally in
their convictions of what children with autism delays need to learn.
Traditional approaches focus on skills and information for becoming a
competent student in cognitive learning and a competent worker. Spontaneous
social behavior is rarely a primary focus of traditional education and yet,
for autistic children, it is the key to lasting relationships and the
ability to use what they might learn academically.
</p><p>
CP sees the child as first needing to learn to develop his current signature
strengths within social relationships. CP views social learning as the key
to spontaneous cognitive learning. in the sense of 'social modeling' that
Albert Bandura has posed for many years. CP begins not by teaching new
skills and behaviors but by learning to socialize with behaviors the child
is already able and motivated to do. CP focuses on helping children learn
and use skills that will help them "learn to learn socially". As a social
learner, the child then has many more opportunities to learn as a part of
life and not be limited to learning what others choose to teach him. While
traditional educational approaches often show successes in academic
learning, they usually do not show spontaneous social changes.
