<p>If *actions* 
become *thoughts* and thoughts become *words* as Jean Piaget so 
eloquently argued in his book "The Origins of Intelligence in Children" (1952), 
then the more actions a child has and uses socially, the more thoughts and words 
he is likely to develop.&nbsp; One of our first questions when we assess a child 
is, "What is he doing?"&nbsp; We assume that the more a child does, the more he 
knows, and thus the more he has to communicate about.&nbsp; In our work, we take 
care to point out to parents and professionals the child's actions and sounds 
that often go unnoticed.&nbsp; These are the seeds of future 
communications.&nbsp; The more sensitively we notice a child's little actions 
and sounds, the more likely the child is to make them again and perhaps to make 
them more like our own. Therefore, when an adult tells us, "I can't 
think of what to do with my child," we say, "First look at what he is doing, 
follow his lead, and then do something that keeps him doing his things with 
you."</p>
<h3>Use a Variety of Actions&nbsp; </h3>
<p>A disturbing 
sight is a child who plays in the same ways with many objects.&nbsp; He must 
learn that different things require different actions, but he must not be taught 
to do things in the "correct adult" ways at first.&nbsp; Any new action, if 
safe,&nbsp; is good for learning.&nbsp; You can encourage your child to explore 
actions and sounds by playing around with changing them yourself.&nbsp; If a 
child is to learn the countless combinations of actions and sounds he needs to 
become a communicator, he must learn that it is not only&nbsp; acceptable, but 
necessary, to experiment fully with the actions and sounds he already&nbsp; 
has.&nbsp; Therefore, interact with him in ways that increase, rather than 
decrease, his attempts to make actions&nbsp; and sounds with you.&nbsp; Keep 
doing whatever you do when your child continues to act and sound, and consider 
reducing what you do when he reduces his actions and sounds.&nbsp; 
</p>
<h3>Show Functionality and Meaningfulness of Actions </h3>
<p>Only after 
your child can perform a range of actions and sounds randomly or with little 
apparent purpose should you begin to look for purpose and meaning in his 
behavior.&nbsp; A&nbsp; child is likely to perform actions meaningfully if he 
has already explored these actions freely and discovered personal meanings and 
uses for them.&nbsp; The more meaningful his actions, the more ideas he may 
have.&nbsp; And it is his playful ideas that may be the easiest things he can 
first communicate about.</p>
<P>It is important to realize 
that it does not matter so much if your child uses things in the "right" way as 
that he tries to do something purposefully.&nbsp; Here is another skill to 
observe.&nbsp; We often begin playing with a child in the old ways he plays with 
things, so that he attends to us, and then we gradually show him new ways.&nbsp; 
A child who uses a knife as a spoon does have a meaning in his actions.&nbsp; We 
might use the knife the way he does, then show how he can cut.&nbsp; Then we may 
give him something that can be cut and hold up the knife.&nbsp; Not only does he 
learn a new meaning this way, he learns a way to communicate about 
cutting. </P>
<h3>Use Actions Symbolically: Make one Thing Stand for Another</h3>
<p>We are often excited when a child imitates, or 
better yet, shows pretend play.&nbsp; Eventually we hope for words or gestures 
and signs, which are symbols.&nbsp; A symbol is anything that stands for or 
represents something else.&nbsp; So when a child takes a paper as a blanket for 
putting her doll to bed, she is showing a symbolic behavior.&nbsp; She can make 
the paper stand in for a blanket, just as words will later stand for other 
things.&nbsp; If we allow anything to be a symbol for anything else, however 
unexpected, children enjoy the game and often stay for more.&nbsp; Surprises 
appear to be reinforcing for many children; they stay and signal us to do 
more.&nbsp; We find that we can keep a child taking turns by doing a variety of 
symbolic play even when the child is not yet symbolic in his play.&nbsp; As a 
child eventually begins to use old actions for new meanings, he is freed from 
his learned set of skills and can multiply them.&nbsp; Then his interactions 
become more flexible, communicative, and rewarding to both him and his partner.&nbsp; 
</P>
<h3>Use Actions Appropriate to a Variety of 
Play</h3>
<p>Ask yourself this question:&nbsp; Does my child have 
the physical skills to do what I am expecting him to do?&nbsp; In our daily 
routines or enthusiastic play, we often find that we do things a child could not 
try to do.&nbsp; We are several steps ahead of him on that learning 
staircase.&nbsp; Once you attend carefully to your child's skills, you can begin 
to match your level of behavior to his.&nbsp; Then when you&nbsp; are doing 
things he can do, you are likely to find him staying with you longer and trying 
to do what you do.</p> <cite>Dr. Jim MacDonald (Becoming Partners with 
Children, 1989) pages 121,122</cite>
