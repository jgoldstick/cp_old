<p>While we may think of 
communicative relationships as based on ideas and words, children find the 
beginnings of relationships in any actions that can be shared.&nbsp; Infants 
begin to interact as they and their caregivers move and make sounds back and 
forth in any ways available to them.&nbsp; When faced with children who are not 
interacting or communicating as well as we would expect for their age, we must 
remember that children must begin by interacting if they are to learn to&nbsp; 
communicate.&nbsp; The problem of low interactive participation is an extremely 
serious one, one that can undermine all the efforts of home and school to make a 
child social and communicative. * It is critical for a child's caregivers to 
realize that every interaction is an opportunity to become social and 
communicative.*&nbsp;&nbsp; Conversely, the less the child interacts, the less 
he will learn to socialize and communicate.&nbsp; </p><p>It is easy for many 
adults to see a child play primarily alone and say, "He seems happy and I know 
play is good for him, so I suppose he'll come to me when he's ready to 
communicate."&nbsp; This widespread view that interactions with people is 
optional and not critical for a child may be one of the most pervasive problems 
facing a child with delays.&nbsp; Regular frequent and sustained interactions 
must become a habit if any delayed child is to become a social and communicative 
member of society.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Low Activity Level </h3>
<p>To become 
social, a child must be active.&nbsp; A passive or lethargic child will give 
others few opportunites to interact with him.&nbsp; Other people will&nbsp; have 
to initiate to a child who may be sending signals to not interact.&nbsp; *Every 
action of a child is an opportunity to learn and a potential signal for others 
to interact.*&nbsp; Your relationship with your child may be unintentionally 
telling him that doing little is acceptable, particularly if he is accustomed to 
being cared for and not being expected&nbsp; to participate.&nbsp; 
</p><h3>Purposeless or Random Actions</h3><p>Frequently we see child 
move with no apparent reason or no relationship to what others are doing.&nbsp; 
* A basic principle of our program is that every action or sound of a child can 
become an interaction and communication if other react as if it were. 
Consequently, be aware of your child's seemingly meaningless behaviors; with 
care you can make them interactive by gently showing the child how to do them 
with you.&nbsp; The more you enter your child's world, act like him, and wait 
for him to participate, the more likely your child's behavior will become social 
and meaningful.*&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><h3>Playful, but Not Social Behavior-- Plays on 
Own Activity&nbsp; </h3>
<p>A disturbing sight is a number of children playing 
alone, with their caregivers assuming that the children are learning all they 
need.&nbsp; While playing alone is essential for many reasons-- cognitive 
skills, self-esteem, among others-- playing and interacting with people is 
essential for learning to be social and communicative.&nbsp; While playing 
alone, a child may be learning a great deal, but for that learning to become 
communicated and useful in relationships, he must practice and express it with 
others regularly.&nbsp; The kind of modeling and fine-tuning a child needs to 
continue learning is available mainly&nbsp; in interactions that are matched and 
responsive and that allow him freedom to act on his own motivations.&nbsp; 
</p><h3>Passive Style&nbsp; </h3><p>A pervasive problem that concerns us in our 
work with children is the passiveness that children with delays display with 
adults and peers alike.&nbsp; Throughout this book we propose that these 
children are the victims of "learned helplessness"; that is, they have learned 
that interacting often faces them with impossible&nbsp; tasks, while acting 
helpless allows them to maintain the status quo.&nbsp; Although the status quo 
may not be great, it is comfortable and the children have no good reason to 
change.&nbsp; </p><p>Passive children often send a signal to others not to 
approach and certainly not to expect much new.&nbsp; Unfortunately, passive 
children often reward caretakers with compliant behavior&nbsp; and little 
time-consuming resistance.&nbsp; A child who is passive is a child who is not 
participating in learning and frequently is not showing the extensive knowledge 
and skills he may have.&nbsp; Our goals with passive children are that they 
interact, physically prompted if necessary; that they learn that not only is 
interacting possible but also that it will provide rewards; and that&nbsp; they 
follow their own motivations.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Lack of Give and Take with Actions</h3>
<p>It is understandable that some adults view communicating as the 
place for children and adults to build a give-and-take social habit and playing 
as the child's world to explore alone.&nbsp; But once adults realize that 
communications come from actions, they come to see the value of building a 
give-and-take habit with any actions available to the child.&nbsp; Consider that 
every time you interact&nbsp; back and forth with a child, you are showing him 
the way to communicate and build conversational habits.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Same Actions Over and Over </h3>
<p>Children whose actions, alone or with others, do 
not regularly change may be in developmental trouble.&nbsp; Children who drop 
endless checkers into a can, make identical movements to music, or perseverate 
in other ways are unlikely to be learning either cognitively or socially.&nbsp; 
Regardless of the reasons for this behavior, it is not productive and it may not 
represent what the child is capable of doing.&nbsp; Through turntaking a child 
learns to act and communicate with people in a give-and-take format that teaches 
new behaviors and that the new behaviors will be more productive than old 
ones.&nbsp; </p><h3>Failure to Keep Attending&nbsp; to Shared Activity 
</h3><p>Inadequate and wandering attention is certainly one of the most 
frequently reported problems of children.&nbsp; It is essential that children 
with delays stay in interactions if they are to learn.&nbsp; Language meanings 
are learned through shared activities, as are the social rules for 
communication.&nbsp; </p><p>While attention is a vast issue in learning and is 
discussed elsewhere in this book, a few points can be noted here.&nbsp; We have 
found that a child is likely to attend with others to the degree 
that&nbsp;&nbsp; a) the child is successful,&nbsp; b)&nbsp; the adult matches 
the child's interests and abilities and allows the child to participate through 
the adult's&nbsp; waiting and expecting,&nbsp; c) the adult and child both have 
the opportunity to take the lead and control the event,&nbsp; d) there is a 
sense of enjoyment rather than work or testing, and&nbsp; e) the child has a 
sense that the event actively belongs to him and that he is not placed in a 
passive role.</p><h3>Brief or Dead-end Contacts During Activity&nbsp; </h3>
<p>In the busy world of home and classroom, it is 
reasonable to have a brief contact that gets a job done or solves a problem, 
then move on to another task.&nbsp; Parents and teachers alike report that it 
takes no noticeably extra time to keep a child for one or two turns in 
interactions&nbsp; that are laced throughout&nbsp; daily routines and leisure 
time.&nbsp; With the notion that any interaction is an opportunity to 
communicate, we stress&nbsp; to adults the critical importance of teaching their 
children that extended interactions must be a way of life if they are to build 
communicative partnerships.&nbsp; We&nbsp; consistently return to a general 
recommendation for building interactions to "keep the child back and forth a little longer."&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><cite>Dr. Jim MacDonald, Becoming
