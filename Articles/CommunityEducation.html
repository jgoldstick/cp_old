<h2>Community Education</h2>
<p>A major mission of the Communicating Partners Center is to disseminate the programs into a national network of parents and professionals. To do this, we have developed and tested a series of training sessions directed to the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Before Speech:</em> practical approaches to preparing nonverbal children for social language 
</li>
<li><em>First words and conversations:</em> practical approaches to social uses of language 
</li>
<li><em>Parent-child Communication:</em> training in a developmentally effective model for communicating with preverbal and early verbal children 
</li>
<li><em>Communication programs in group and classroom settings </em>
</li>
<li><em>Parent communication</em> 
</li>
<li><em>Down Syndrome:</em> building communicative relationships 
</li>
<li><em>Autism and PDD:</em> recovery through building communicative relationships 
</li>
<li><em>Communicating during behavior problem:</em> the key to more civil and appropriate behavior 
</li>
<li><em>Parent group communication programs:</em> a new culture for late talking children 
</li>
<li><em>Late talking children:</em> a growing problem and homebound solutions 
</li>
<li><em>Communicative approaches to early literacy:</em> a mutually productive approach</li>
</ul>

<h3>PROFESSIONAL WORKSHOPS:</h3>
<p>The purpose of our <a href="FCommunityEducation/WorkshopDayOne.html">training workshops </a> is to help you establish and continue relationship based communication programs. Consequently, we prefer to include the following in each workshop of two or more days: </p>
<ul>
<li>Lectures on over 25 years of clinical research findings 
</li>
<li>Live demonstration and coaching with a sample of children and adult partners 
</li>
<li>Practical training in use of assessment tools 
</li>
<li>Video demonstrations of the clinical model 
</li>
<li>Planning sessions with parents, teachers and therapists in adopting the program into their system 
</li>
<li>Demonstration of a series of manuals for implementing the program</li>
</ul>
<h3>COURSES AVAILABLE:</h3>
<p>Beyond the workshop model, we have developed three course curricula for extensive training and for continuing education credits. Each course runs from 16-30 contact hours, and is designed to satisfy continuing education needs of teachers, therapists, daycare providers and others responsible for children learning to communicate. 
</p><ol>
<li>Communication development for preverbal children. 
</li>
<li>Social and conversational development for early verbal children. 
</li>
<li>Parent Child communication with language learning children.</li>
</ol>
<h3>PARENT-TO-PARENT GROUPS</h3>
<p>
Another particular interest of ours is to assist parents in establishing parent-to-parent training and support groups. We believe that parents have much to offer each other in their task of helping children communicate. We have available a series of video training tapes and practical manuals that parents can use together to build relationships with their children. An added benefit has been to create a community of friends for children who are often more isolated than they need to be. 
</p>
<p>Upon request, we will provide you references of parents who have managed such groups. </p>
<h3>ON-LINE DISCUSSION</h3>
<p>We also encourage you to take part in our On-Line discussion group on the internet. Using your email program you will receive and can respond to messages from other parents and from Dr. MacDonald.<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/communicating"> Its free and its easy to sign up.</a> 
</p>
<h3>SCHOOL WIDE ADOPTION</h3>
<p>Given the traditionally academic orientation of many education programs, we have developed programs for schools to adopt the Communicating Partners social and communicative curriculum as a necessary supplement to cognitive and academic programs. The CP curriculum has the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>to focus on training children to be social partners before they are students 
</li>
<li>to ensure that children can communicate the academic goals of the school 
</li>
<li>to provide practical tools for parents and teachers to share in a coordinated effort to socialize the children 
</li>
<li>to increase the interactive frequency, duration and variety of children who lack habitual social skills 
</li>
<li>to provide a social environment in the classroom that prepares children for social life in the world</li>
</ul>
