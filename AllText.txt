I thought it might be useful to send you some
ideas on the question of How does the Communicating Partners approach differ
from other approaches to language delayed children. I feel the more you
understand what we are trying to do and the principles we follow, the
easier it will be to grow with us....Thank you ,Jim</p>


<p> Many parents face a confusing dilemma with their
child-whether to change him to act 'normal' or to accept him and help him
develop as the best unique person he can be. In 30 years we have found that
children become much more social and communicative when parents play an
active part in helping the child develop his unique strengths rather than in
changing his basic nature. The discussion below highlights some of the
differences between the communicating partners approach that views the child
as developing signature strengths and needing to become social and
communicative first and traditional approaches that focus on making the
child a compliant student first.
</p>

<h3>THE ISSUE OF CURE VS. DEVELOPMENT</h3>
<p>
Parents understandably are driven to "cure" as many of their child's
ailments as possible. They treat a cold, fix a broken leg and teach
children to solve problems. Consequently, it is reasonable when faced with
autism, they are immediately drawn to "fix' it or to seek a cure. This urge
is natural and well intentioned. The problem with focusing on "curing" the
"problem" is that it may lead to throwing the baby out with the bath water.
What I mean is that, when we try to stop a child from being autistic or
acting in his own ways, we are often discouraging the abilities and
interests every child has. Parents looking for a cure for autism often
think they need to wait until the child is "normal" before having a "real"
relationship with him. In so doing, they miss many critical opportunities
to relate in ways that help him develop.
</p><p>
Communicating Partners takes the approach of positive psychology (Seligman,
2001) by addressing the child's "signature " strengths rather than his
weaknesses. The goal is social development not cure. And the starting point
is how the child is currently developing. This approach supports the child's
interests and key abilities, so that he will develop more positively and
less negatively. We see each child as having some "signature" strengths can
be built upon to form durable relationships. We are convinced that almost
every child with autism or other delays can develop authentic relationships
and that his total development depends on those relationships. While we
have seen many persons, diagnosed with "autistic or pdd", become persons who
no longer fit the diagnosis, our goal is not a cure. Rather our goal is to
help children develop as many social relationships as they can.
Consequently, an enduring goal of our approach is to help the child use
his current strengths in becoming social and communicative.
</p>
 <h3>2. VIEWS OF which comes first: STUDENT OR SOCIAL PARTNER</h3>
<p>Traditional education and Communicating Partners differ fundamentally in
their convictions of what children with autism delays need to learn.
Traditional approaches focus on skills and information for becoming a
competent student in cognitive learning and a competent worker. Spontaneous
social behavior is rarely a primary focus of traditional education and yet,
for autistic children, it is the key to lasting relationships and the
ability to use what they might learn academically.
</p><p>
CP sees the child as first needing to learn to develop his current signature
strengths within social relationships. CP views social learning as the key
to spontaneous cognitive learning. in the sense of 'social modeling' that
Albert Bandura has posed for many years. CP begins not by teaching new
skills and behaviors but by learning to socialize with behaviors the child
is already able and motivated to do. CP focuses on helping children learn
and use skills that will help them "learn to learn socially". As a social
learner, the child then has many more opportunities to learn as a part of
life and not be limited to learning what others choose to teach him. While
traditional educational approaches often show successes in academic
learning, they usually do not show spontaneous social changes.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Responding
<p> I'd like to say a few words about why we encourage you to "RESPOND" to your child. Many people seem to misunderstand this. I'll keep short. and look for responses. (you see, just like your child is you respond to me I will come back more to you!)</p>


<p>
 Why should I respond to what my child does when I really want him to do something else?</p>
 <p>

</p>
 <p> This is a common question , spoken or unspoken, when I encourage people to respond to anything positive their child does.

</p>
 <p>Why respond? Because responding is the best way to get the child to do what he can do, feel successful, and stay interacting with you.


</p>
 <p>The recent stories on this list of parents who have turned their relationships around just by doing what their child does is strong support for the strength of responding.

</p>
 <p>When we respond to what a child does spontaneously, we are doing several things.
 </p>
<ol>
 <li>we are supporting him for what he can do.
</li>
<li>
</li>
<li>we are showing him we respect his interests
</li>
<li>we are showing him that his behavior can be socially successful; that is, it can get responses from people.
</li>
<li>It teaches him exactly what we want him to do with us---RESPOND--- A major problem with language delayed and other children is that they do not respond in social situations.
</li>
<li>we are telling him he is okay
</li>
<li>we are entering his developmental world, which is just the place from witch he can learn something more in little steps.
</li>
</ol>
 <p>I'll stop for now; I have just finished a new book on this so I better to get obsessive.</p><p>Jim</p>

<p>
ps: remember the goal of Communicating Partners is not for the child to perform but to spontaneously interact. And he will interact more when you respond to whatever he is doing ( as long as it is safe and not obnoxious).</p>


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Use Actions
<p>If *actions* 
become *thoughts* and thoughts become *words* as Jean Piaget so 
eloquently argued in his book "The Origins of Intelligence in Children" (1952), 
then the more actions a child has and uses socially, the more thoughts and words 
he is likely to develop.&nbsp; One of our first questions when we assess a child 
is, "What is he doing?"&nbsp; We assume that the more a child does, the more he 
knows, and thus the more he has to communicate about.&nbsp; In our work, we take 
care to point out to parents and professionals the child's actions and sounds 
that often go unnoticed.&nbsp; These are the seeds of future 
communications.&nbsp; The more sensitively we notice a child's little actions 
and sounds, the more likely the child is to make them again and perhaps to make 
them more like our own. Therefore, when an adult tells us, "I can't 
think of what to do with my child," we say, "First look at what he is doing, 
follow his lead, and then do something that keeps him doing his things with 
you."</p>
<h3>Use a Variety of Actions&nbsp; </h3>
<p>A disturbing 
sight is a child who plays in the same ways with many objects.&nbsp; He must 
learn that different things require different actions, but he must not be taught 
to do things in the "correct adult" ways at first.&nbsp; Any new action, if 
safe,&nbsp; is good for learning.&nbsp; You can encourage your child to explore 
actions and sounds by playing around with changing them yourself.&nbsp; If a 
child is to learn the countless combinations of actions and sounds he needs to 
become a communicator, he must learn that it is not only&nbsp; acceptable, but 
necessary, to experiment fully with the actions and sounds he already&nbsp; 
has.&nbsp; Therefore, interact with him in ways that increase, rather than 
decrease, his attempts to make actions&nbsp; and sounds with you.&nbsp; Keep 
doing whatever you do when your child continues to act and sound, and consider 
reducing what you do when he reduces his actions and sounds.&nbsp; 
</p>
<h3>Show Functionality and Meaningfulness of Actions </h3>
<p>Only after 
your child can perform a range of actions and sounds randomly or with little 
apparent purpose should you begin to look for purpose and meaning in his 
behavior.&nbsp; A&nbsp; child is likely to perform actions meaningfully if he 
has already explored these actions freely and discovered personal meanings and 
uses for them.&nbsp; The more meaningful his actions, the more ideas he may 
have.&nbsp; And it is his playful ideas that may be the easiest things he can 
first communicate about.</p>
<P>It is important to realize 
that it does not matter so much if your child uses things in the "right" way as 
that he tries to do something purposefully.&nbsp; Here is another skill to 
observe.&nbsp; We often begin playing with a child in the old ways he plays with 
things, so that he attends to us, and then we gradually show him new ways.&nbsp; 
A child who uses a knife as a spoon does have a meaning in his actions.&nbsp; We 
might use the knife the way he does, then show how he can cut.&nbsp; Then we may 
give him something that can be cut and hold up the knife.&nbsp; Not only does he 
learn a new meaning this way, he learns a way to communicate about 
cutting. </P>
<h3>Use Actions Symbolically: Make one Thing Stand for Another</h3>
<p>We are often excited when a child imitates, or 
better yet, shows pretend play.&nbsp; Eventually we hope for words or gestures 
and signs, which are symbols.&nbsp; A symbol is anything that stands for or 
represents something else.&nbsp; So when a child takes a paper as a blanket for 
putting her doll to bed, she is showing a symbolic behavior.&nbsp; She can make 
the paper stand in for a blanket, just as words will later stand for other 
things.&nbsp; If we allow anything to be a symbol for anything else, however 
unexpected, children enjoy the game and often stay for more.&nbsp; Surprises 
appear to be reinforcing for many children; they stay and signal us to do 
more.&nbsp; We find that we can keep a child taking turns by doing a variety of 
symbolic play even when the child is not yet symbolic in his play.&nbsp; As a 
child eventually begins to use old actions for new meanings, he is freed from 
his learned set of skills and can multiply them.&nbsp; Then his interactions 
become more flexible, communicative, and rewarding to both him and his partner.&nbsp; 
</P>
<h3>Use Actions Appropriate to a Variety of 
Play</h3>
<p>Ask yourself this question:&nbsp; Does my child have 
the physical skills to do what I am expecting him to do?&nbsp; In our daily 
routines or enthusiastic play, we often find that we do things a child could not 
try to do.&nbsp; We are several steps ahead of him on that learning 
staircase.&nbsp; Once you attend carefully to your child's skills, you can begin 
to match your level of behavior to his.&nbsp; Then when you&nbsp; are doing 
things he can do, you are likely to find him staying with you longer and trying 
to do what you do.</p> <cite>Dr. Jim MacDonald (Becoming Partners with 
Children, 1989) pages 121,122</cite>

Allow The Child Success
<p>We hope you will come to appreciate that a success for your child at this time is simply staying with you in play. Your friendly response is his reward.  He will not need you to say things like "good boy" or "good talking." In fact, responses like this easily become rote and artificial and often put a stop to any interaction you have going.  Your job is to keep the interaction going. </p><p>Your child will know he is succeeding if you simply accept what he does and show him respect by doing something like it. Success for your child has probably been doing what he can do independently, but now he needs successes with people.  To grow, a child need not learn to do anything new with people until he can do in people play what he already knows as he plays alone.  And why do we care if your child has successes with people?  Because successes with people help him feel safe and good, and most important, competent.  Unfortunately, for many delayed children, chances to feel competent are few and far between.  A child who feels competent will try more so that successes increase the likelihood that a delayed child will stay with people and make a habit of it.  On the other hand, failures, as when a child cannot answer your question or comply with your command, may discourage him staying or starting up with new  people. </p><p>The point here is that you have your child's successes in your control.  There is no avoiding it-- you either give him successes or you don't.  If you simply respond sensitively to his little actions and any new surprising things, you will soon learn what he needs to do next and how you can encourage him to do it.  Just remember:  When a child is learning to be social, a success is any behavior he does with people and any new behaviors. </p><h3>Avoid Corrections or Discouraging Feedback</h3>
<p>Tied closely to helping a child have successes, this recommendation is simply a warning that, for a child with a long history of failures, corrections or any feedback suggesting what he did was wrong may drive him away from the necessary person-to-person contacts he needs.  Of course, you certainly do not intend to drive him away from people when you get him to do it "right" or otherwise let him know that what he did was not enough.  Nevertheless, be aware that you may be doing just that very effectively in spite of your motives.  Until your child has developed a strong habit of social play, it is successes, not failures, that will get him into that habit. </p>
<h3>Avoid Testing or Focus on Right and Wrong</h3>
<p>When getting your child into a habit of people play, forget about "right" and "wrong" except for unsafe  or socially abusive actions.  Rather  than saying "Is he right or wrong?" get into the habit of saying "Is he doing it with people?"  Think of your exciting job now as helping your child begin to do with people all the things he can already do by himself.  This change alone would be a major developmental step toward communicating.  Once he is a social person, you will have many opportunites to show him the right steps to new things.  What is more, only if he becomes a social person will you have those opportunities.

Low Interaction
<p>While we may think of 
communicative relationships as based on ideas and words, children find the 
beginnings of relationships in any actions that can be shared.&nbsp; Infants 
begin to interact as they and their caregivers move and make sounds back and 
forth in any ways available to them.&nbsp; When faced with children who are not 
interacting or communicating as well as we would expect for their age, we must 
remember that children must begin by interacting if they are to learn to&nbsp; 
communicate.&nbsp; The problem of low interactive participation is an extremely 
serious one, one that can undermine all the efforts of home and school to make a 
child social and communicative. * It is critical for a child's caregivers to 
realize that every interaction is an opportunity to become social and 
communicative.*&nbsp;&nbsp; Conversely, the less the child interacts, the less 
he will learn to socialize and communicate.&nbsp; </p><p>It is easy for many 
adults to see a child play primarily alone and say, "He seems happy and I know 
play is good for him, so I suppose he'll come to me when he's ready to 
communicate."&nbsp; This widespread view that interactions with people is 
optional and not critical for a child may be one of the most pervasive problems 
facing a child with delays.&nbsp; Regular frequent and sustained interactions 
must become a habit if any delayed child is to become a social and communicative 
member of society.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Low Activity Level </h3>
<p>To become 
social, a child must be active.&nbsp; A passive or lethargic child will give 
others few opportunites to interact with him.&nbsp; Other people will&nbsp; have 
to initiate to a child who may be sending signals to not interact.&nbsp; *Every 
action of a child is an opportunity to learn and a potential signal for others 
to interact.*&nbsp; Your relationship with your child may be unintentionally 
telling him that doing little is acceptable, particularly if he is accustomed to 
being cared for and not being expected&nbsp; to participate.&nbsp; 
</p><h3>Purposeless or Random Actions</h3><p>Frequently we see child 
move with no apparent reason or no relationship to what others are doing.&nbsp; 
* A basic principle of our program is that every action or sound of a child can 
become an interaction and communication if other react as if it were. 
Consequently, be aware of your child's seemingly meaningless behaviors; with 
care you can make them interactive by gently showing the child how to do them 
with you.&nbsp; The more you enter your child's world, act like him, and wait 
for him to participate, the more likely your child's behavior will become social 
and meaningful.*&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><h3>Playful, but Not Social Behavior-- Plays on 
Own Activity&nbsp; </h3>
<p>A disturbing sight is a number of children playing 
alone, with their caregivers assuming that the children are learning all they 
need.&nbsp; While playing alone is essential for many reasons-- cognitive 
skills, self-esteem, among others-- playing and interacting with people is 
essential for learning to be social and communicative.&nbsp; While playing 
alone, a child may be learning a great deal, but for that learning to become 
communicated and useful in relationships, he must practice and express it with 
others regularly.&nbsp; The kind of modeling and fine-tuning a child needs to 
continue learning is available mainly&nbsp; in interactions that are matched and 
responsive and that allow him freedom to act on his own motivations.&nbsp; 
</p><h3>Passive Style&nbsp; </h3><p>A pervasive problem that concerns us in our 
work with children is the passiveness that children with delays display with 
adults and peers alike.&nbsp; Throughout this book we propose that these 
children are the victims of "learned helplessness"; that is, they have learned 
that interacting often faces them with impossible&nbsp; tasks, while acting 
helpless allows them to maintain the status quo.&nbsp; Although the status quo 
may not be great, it is comfortable and the children have no good reason to 
change.&nbsp; </p><p>Passive children often send a signal to others not to 
approach and certainly not to expect much new.&nbsp; Unfortunately, passive 
children often reward caretakers with compliant behavior&nbsp; and little 
time-consuming resistance.&nbsp; A child who is passive is a child who is not 
participating in learning and frequently is not showing the extensive knowledge 
and skills he may have.&nbsp; Our goals with passive children are that they 
interact, physically prompted if necessary; that they learn that not only is 
interacting possible but also that it will provide rewards; and that&nbsp; they 
follow their own motivations.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Lack of Give and Take with Actions</h3>
<p>It is understandable that some adults view communicating as the 
place for children and adults to build a give-and-take social habit and playing 
as the child's world to explore alone.&nbsp; But once adults realize that 
communications come from actions, they come to see the value of building a 
give-and-take habit with any actions available to the child.&nbsp; Consider that 
every time you interact&nbsp; back and forth with a child, you are showing him 
the way to communicate and build conversational habits.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Same Actions Over and Over </h3>
<p>Children whose actions, alone or with others, do 
not regularly change may be in developmental trouble.&nbsp; Children who drop 
endless checkers into a can, make identical movements to music, or perseverate 
in other ways are unlikely to be learning either cognitively or socially.&nbsp; 
Regardless of the reasons for this behavior, it is not productive and it may not 
represent what the child is capable of doing.&nbsp; Through turntaking a child 
learns to act and communicate with people in a give-and-take format that teaches 
new behaviors and that the new behaviors will be more productive than old 
ones.&nbsp; </p><h3>Failure to Keep Attending&nbsp; to Shared Activity 
</h3><p>Inadequate and wandering attention is certainly one of the most 
frequently reported problems of children.&nbsp; It is essential that children 
with delays stay in interactions if they are to learn.&nbsp; Language meanings 
are learned through shared activities, as are the social rules for 
communication.&nbsp; </p><p>While attention is a vast issue in learning and is 
discussed elsewhere in this book, a few points can be noted here.&nbsp; We have 
found that a child is likely to attend with others to the degree 
that&nbsp;&nbsp; a) the child is successful,&nbsp; b)&nbsp; the adult matches 
the child's interests and abilities and allows the child to participate through 
the adult's&nbsp; waiting and expecting,&nbsp; c) the adult and child both have 
the opportunity to take the lead and control the event,&nbsp; d) there is a 
sense of enjoyment rather than work or testing, and&nbsp; e) the child has a 
sense that the event actively belongs to him and that he is not placed in a 
passive role.</p><h3>Brief or Dead-end Contacts During Activity&nbsp; </h3>
<p>In the busy world of home and classroom, it is 
reasonable to have a brief contact that gets a job done or solves a problem, 
then move on to another task.&nbsp; Parents and teachers alike report that it 
takes no noticeably extra time to keep a child for one or two turns in 
interactions&nbsp; that are laced throughout&nbsp; daily routines and leisure 
time.&nbsp; With the notion that any interaction is an opportunity to 
communicate, we stress&nbsp; to adults the critical importance of teaching their 
children that extended interactions must be a way of life if they are to build 
communicative partnerships.&nbsp; We&nbsp; consistently return to a general 
recommendation for building interactions to "keep the child back and forth a little longer."&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><cite>Dr. Jim MacDonald, Becoming

Guidelines for Keeping Childlike Play Going
<ol>
<li>Start with anything safe and socially acceptable that your child does. (This does not mean your child has to play in age-appropriate ways.)&nbsp; 
</li>
<li>Watch what he's doing first. 
</li>
<li>Then quietly join in his activity. 
</li>
<li>Keep your talking down and your actions and sounds up; in fact, being silent may sometimes help you both focus on the play. 
</li>
<li>Try to be like your child. Move when he moves; sound when he sounds. 
</li>
<li>When in doubt as to what to do, imitate your child. You will get his attention and may start an interaction going. 
</li>
<li>When acting like your child, change what you are doing slightly, then see what he does. 
</li>
<li>Give him time to do things on his own. 
</li>
<li>Be sure you and he are in the same activity. 
</li>
<li>Try to do only about as much as your child does; remember to balance your actions, sounds and words with his. 
</li>
<li>Make yourself more interesting than the things that distract your child. This means being inventive and creative-- even being silly is effective.</li>
</ol>
<p>And, very importantly, <strong>Keep him there with you a little longer than he usually stays</strong>. In new activities, keep him only briefly to give him a successful introduction to them. Becoming Partners with Children, Dr. Jim MacDonald (page 75)</p>

Don't Give Up On Speech
<p>Many children can learn to speak long after age 3 and 4, especially ones with muscular and neurological delays such as Down Syndrome, Autism, Apraxia, Cerebral palsy, and other problems.</p>
<p>Do not believe the MYTH that if a child is not talking at 3 or 4 , she will not talk.I am currently working with two brothers with DS who are beginning to talk at 7 and 9.</p>
<p>In 30 years of clinical and research work with late talking children we have found the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Too many people give up on speech too soon.. 
</li>
<li>Children can learn to speak after ages 3 and 4, even as late as 8 and 10. 
</li>
<li>Children with Down Syndrome, Apraxia, and other issues have sever oral motor delays. 
</li>
<li>Before children speak, they need to be CONSTANT SOCIAL SOUNDERS. 
</li>
<li>Adults must enter a child's world of sounds before pushing for word. 
</li>
<li>Imitating your child's sounds is very important for him learning to talk. Make sound imitating your most frequent way to play with your preverbal child. 
</li>
<li>Expecting words too soon can discourage your child from the sounding practice he needs. 
</li>
<li>The most important exercise children need for speech is MAKING A LOT OF SPEECH SOUNDS. 
</li>
<li>Practicing sounding all day long is necessary; therapy sessions are not enough. Learning to speak is like learning to play piano; a child ill not learn piano if he only takes a lesson once a week and does not practice. 
</li>
<li>Parents must learn what children need to do before speech: social play, imitation, turntaking, social sounding and communicating habitually without words. 
</li>
<li>Late-talking children often interact much less than others. 
</li>
<li>The more a child interacts , the more likely will he learn to speak. 
</li>
<li>The more you play in your child's world the more he will speak. 
</li>
<li>The more you pressure him to speak in ways he is not ready the less he will speak. 
</li>
<li>Be a living dictionary: put a word on your child's immediate experience. 
</li>
<li>Be a translator: your child has two languages: one is English and one is his own special language ( call it "Lisa "or "Larry" language) : respond to his special language such as" ee-ee" for"doggie" with the simple word "doggie" 
</li>
<li>Have conversations with sounds before words. 
</li>
<li>Over stimulation is a serious barrier to learning to speak. Be careful not to "bathe" your child with language because you might" drown" him out. 
</li>
<li>Match your child's communication: talk in ways he can talk; avoid talking too much in ways he cannot try to do. 
</li>
<li>Avoid (like the plague) correcting your child's speech or making him feel he is doing something wrong. Simply give him the word clearly without judgment. 
</li>
<li>The more your child feel successes, the more he will speak. 
</li>
<li>Speech for school or performance ( show and tell) is not enough. Make sure your child is really communicating with people not just answering questions or reciting things. 
</li>
<li>Signing can help at first, but do not depend on it; go for speech. I know many children who sign hundreds of words but rarely speak to people; be very careful. 
</li>
<li>Talking back and forth in many turns is more important that combining words in long sentences. FOCUS ON MORE TURNS BEFORE MORE WORDS. 
</li>
<li>Children talk more when you join in his enjoyable activities.. 
</li>
<li>Parents are the best language teacher: Your child learns to talk in every interaction you have; not in school or therapy.</li>
</ol>

A Guide to Conversation
<p>What kind of conversation partner do you want?</p>
<p>Consider the kind of conversation partner you want in your relationships. Below are features many people seek. These are also crucial goals for your child if he is to develop lasting relationships. Use the list as a guide, first, for what you can do with your child, and second as a way to identify your child's strengths and needs in becoming a conversational partner.</p>
<ol>
<li>Partners who take turns with you. 
</li>
<li>They wait silently in anticipation for your turn. 
</li>
<li>They listen and respond meaningfully to what you meant. 
</li>
<li>They keep you with them if the conversation falters. 
</li>
<li>They respond meaningfully to both your words and your feelings. 
</li>
<li>They stay on the topics that you start for a few exchanges. 
</li>
<li>They encourage you to stay on topic they start. 
</li>
<li>They're seldom focus on getting something from you. 
</li>
<li>They communicate mainly for the pleasure of your company. 
</li>
<li>They do not compete with you for a "right" answer. 
</li>
<li>They clearly show that they enjoy conversations with you. 
</li>
<li>They feel they learn from you without being taught. 
</li>
<li>They seldom direct or controls the conversation. 
</li>
<li>They do not allow you to direct or control the conversation. 
</li>
<li>They do not dominate with continuous questions. 
</li>
<li>They make you want to return for more conversations. 
</li>
<li>They disagree without aggression.</li>
</ol>
<p>Consider this list a rough guide to see what kind of conversation partners you and your child are. You will be able to identify the strengths and we encourage you to first work on them. Build your conversations with your child by building more and more of the good conversations you have. Do not focus on fixing the major problems you have. Some of them may not be fixable now and some will diminish when you make an effort to have more and more positive conversations.</p>
<p>Note: I'd appreciate any reactions since this will be a part of the book I am writing on autism and related communication conditions.</p>

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Failures?
<p>Hi all, I will send to you little pieces of the new book I'm writing from time to time. This piece applies to almost every family I have worked with. I am convinced that the less you "see" failures and the more you see "successes" the better your child will develop. Remember what is "right" for you is not usually developmentally "right" for your child. Jim</p>
<p>Perhaps the one reason for undesired behavior that concerns us the most is the child's emotional reaction to failing at a task. Actually, this should be restated as the child's reaction to "feeling" he is failing at a task. It is so easy for our children to come to believe that they are doing something wrong or failing when they are simply operating the way their current nervous system allows them to do so. </p>
<p>Three basic assumptions of Communicating Partners relate directly to the issue of children's perceived "failures":</p>
<ol>
<li>Children do not make developmental mistakes; whatever they do is what they can do at the moment on the basis of their abilities, history and environment 
</li>
<li>One of the most developmentally harmful things we can teach a child is to feel "wrong" about what he is doing and that he should be someone he is not. 
</li>
<li>Each child, regardless of his developmental delays, has some "signature strengths" that can be supported to help him build interactive relationships.</li>
</ol>
<p>The goal of Communicating Partners is not to fix or repair problems a child is perceived to have but rather to build on his current signature strengths. We restate these principles here because we have seen so many cases of difficult behavior problems that result from the child and parents' perceptions that the child is failing at developmental tasks. We strongly feel that when the child and parents share the attitude that the child is not doing what he should be doing, conflicts develop that lead to continued disruptions in the confidence and competence of both parent and child. When parents and children feel they have to do the impossible, all sorts of disturbances occur and a general tug of war or depression can occur. When this happens, "behavior problems" will abound in the vacuum of any positive flow.</p>

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Children Talking to Themselves
<p>Barbara asked me to comment on a concern many are having; their children talking to themselves. </p>
<p>Why do you think that would happen?</p>
<p>Watch your child and consider if some of the following reasons might apply.</p>

<ol>
<li>
It feels good to his muscles.
</li>
<li>
He likes hearing the sounds.
</li>
<li>
Others are not doing all the talking.
</li>
<li>
He knows he won't be interrupted.
</li>
<li>
He is free to say whatever he can.
</li>
<li>
He enjoys practicing the new skill of sounding.
</li>
<li>
He is imitating how others talk.
</li>
<li>
He's pretending to talk to his toys.
</li>
<li>
He's telling a story.
</li>
<li>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
So you may be surprised that there are so many positive reasons.
Now the problems; Too much self talk will isolate the child and mark him as unusual and he will not be communicating.
</p>
Children often talk more to themselves than to others, with the other people dominate interaction with so much talk that the child has no chance to talk.
<ul>
<li>
The child may be discouraged fro talking since he is corrected and made to feel he's doing something wrong.
</li>
<li>
People may not respond to the sounds he can make and so he gives up.
</li>
<li>
People respond to his sounds with more words than he can try to do.
</li>
<li>
People do not join into the child's play and show him how his sounds can communicate.
</li>
<li>
People do not play with his sounds as the important developmental toys they can be.
</li>
<li>
Children often expect others will talk for him, since they often do so.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
TREAT YOUR CHILD'S SOUNDS LIKE THE MOST VALUABLE TOYS TO PLAY WITH HIM.</h3>
<p>
If he is talking to himself, get in there and accept anything he says with no corrections; your job is to teach him to be a constant social sounder who learns that any sounds will effectively get your attention.</p>
<h3>TRY THE FOLLOWING.</h3>
<ul>
<li>IMITATE YOUR CHILD'S SOUNDS
</li>
<li>
PLAY WITH SOUNDS BACK AND FORTH
</li>
<li>
TRANSLATE HIS SOUND INTO ONE WORD THAT MAKES SENSE.
</li>
<li>
ALLOW SILENT TIME WITH YOUR CHILD; GIVE HIM TIM TO TALK.
</li>
<li>
BELIEVE THAT "NO SOUND IS A MISTAKE" - IF YOU WANT MORE, SHOW HIM HOW
</li>
<li>
TAKE TURNS WITH SOUNDS FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE WORRYING ABOUT WORDS.
TREAT ANY SOUND LIKE A DIAMOND UNTIL YOUR CHILD IS A CONSTANT SOCIAL SOUNDER.
</li>
</ul>

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Turntaking -- a bit more
<p>You may be tired of hearing about TURNTAKING but Cathy's message today reminded me that even when a 7 year old child is talking well, we need to revisit turntaking. Why? Because in the excitement of hearing your child talk, it is easy to assume that she is "a taker". We can think that once talking starts it will just flow. Well, I know too many children whose language doesn't to just flow,unless he is still interacting in turntaking ways nonverbally as well.</p>
<p>A recent comment I read might be of interest here:</p>
<p>Q. Until I learned how easy turn taking was, I thought I had to sit down and teach Louis to talk like I taught him other skills for school. Now he babbles and grumbles and make funny motions back and for the while eating, dressing, cleaning up; it is part of our life now and Louis is not only communicating more on his own , he is also starting to communicate more like me. </p>
<p>My response was; Once you discover that communication can happen with any behaviors, you will see you will get much more from your son than before. It comes as natural as breathing and make both you and your child successful with each other. In fact, why not think of turntaking as "social breathing"; You breathe in your child's turn and you then breathe out your turn. This may seem strange but think of you and your child as one interactive life and then you can see how interactive life depends on each of you 'breathing ' back and forth with each other.</p>

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
What's Right For You May Be Wrong For Your Child
<p>Another obstacle to social play is the adult's insistence on goal- oriented rather than child-centered play that produces stress or results in more failures than successes is more punishment the play for both you and your child. The notion that there is only a right or wrong way to do things often deters the child who is not yet ready for the whole thing. Stephanie threw a ball halfway to her mother who responded, "No, throw all the way to me". The girl was just learning to throw but her mother did not accept little steps. After several such exchanges, the girl stopped interacting. Once her mother learned to accept any attempt the girl interacted more and her mother had the chance to show her more mature ways to interact.</p>
<p>If your child were learning to climb stairs, you certainly would not place him on the bottom step, then go to the top step and say (Come on up and get me!). No, you would be on the next step coaching him to make the gains he could do. The same applies when children are beginning to socialize; any attempt to interact is a success. </p>
<p>Parents and professionals regularly want their child to play with things in the "right" way. Often what is considered "right" to parents is actually "adult" behavior or at least not developmentally the next step for the child. In order to help parents appreciate the difference between their view of "Right" and what is developmentally "right", I may whimsically as them " How well does he drive a car or balance his checkbook?" The point of this nonsense question is that we are often expecting of children behaviors that they are not ready to do, like driving or dealing with finances. This common desire for a child to do things "right" when right means doing it in the adult's way highlights the fact that we adults often interpret a child's a behavior in adult terms and not in terms of what is right developmentally for a child. Once you enter your child's world by actively participating in it, you will get to intuitively know what is a developmentally "right" next step for your child. You will no longer expect adult or other impossible behavior of him; rather you will expect him only to do three things, first, to do more of what he is doing, second, to do it socially with people, and third to do just a little more that is possible.</p>

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Share Control
<p>We are more likely to stay in conversation when both persons are sharing their ideas. If we always have to initiate the topic and keep the conversation going with our ideas, we soon withdraw, sometimes even from the relationship. On the other hand, if the other persons regularly control the topic and ignore our ideas, we are likely to go to someone who will show us more respect. So, too, should you follow your child's ideas at times and at other times see to it the he follows our. Because it its sometimes appropriate for one of you to carry most of the ideas, as when relating a story or giving directions, there are natural opportunities for you to hear your child's ideas and others for him to listen to yours.</p><p>
Adults and children are much more likely to stay in conversations when they expect their ideas will be heard. Therefore, have several brief conversations with your child every day, conversations where there is no job or lesson to get done.The goal is to listen to his ideas and make sure he listens to some of yours. This takes very little time, usually less than a minute. It will require that each of you has a say on the topic.</p>
<p>In the example below, Calvin and his dad build a conversation on a topic that each partner contributes to. </p>
<dl>
<dt class="p1">Dad: </dt><dd>Hey, your bike looks broken.</dd>
<dt>Calvin: </dt><dd>It wiggles</dd>
<dt class="p1">Dad: </dt><dd>Let me see. What wiggles?</dd>
<dt>Calvin: </dt><dd> The wheel. It wiggled and I feel and got hurt.</dd>
<dt class="p1">Dad: </dt><dd>Let's have a look. You have a scratch.</dd>
<dt>Calvin: </dt><dd> Ouch, don't touch.</dd>
<dt class="p1">Dad: </dt><dd>it's a wiggle owie. You need a wiggle doctor.</dd>
<dt>Calvin: </dt><dd> You're silly. Fix my bike.</dd>
<dt class="p1">Dad: </dt><dd>What?</dd>
<dt>Calvin: </dt><dd> Please.</dd>
<dt class="p1">Dad: </dt><dd>Look, the spokes are loose. 
</dd>
<dt>Calvin: </dt><dd> What's a poke?</dd>
<dt class="p1">Dad: </dt><dd>Spoke, ssspoke- these wire sticks. They make the wheel strong.</dd>
<dt>Calvin: </dt><dd> I found a loose one.</dd>

<p>Notice how the conversation flowed from the activity they did together and how each person had his say and responded meaningfully to what the other said. They shared control and respected what each person said. Each person led and followed the topic at times. If the father simply fixed the bike, Calvin would have missed a valuable opportunity to learn conversation skills and to learn how to think and talk about a new topic. Calvin could practice his old ideas and get some new ones from his father. </p>
<p>I think of an old friend Vern when I remember this story. Vern said: 
<blockquote><p>Before I learned to take turns with Sally and realized how important conversations were for her, I thought my job was to tell her as much as I could. Now I feel much of that was wasted time and I recall Sally not liking it at all. Waiting for Sally to say something was very hard at first. I had so many ideas about what she should be saying that I had to slow down, be quiet and find out what she really wanted to talk about. </p>
<p>I tried your ping-pong idea and then I came up with idea of my own. I kept the image of a pendulum in my mind. When I talked, the pendulum ball was with me, and then when I waited, the ball went to Sally, then it came back to me. With the goal of keeping the pendulum moving, I tried not to hold onto it by saying too much. Whenever the pendulum in my mind was stuck on my side, I stopped talking and let it go. When the pendulum was stuck on Sally's side I silently signaled her to give me a turn or gently took a turn. Keeping the pendulum swings in mind, I could visualize how important it was that each of us take our turn and then move on.</p></blockquote>
<p>TRY THINKING OF A PENDULUM IN YOUR CONVERSATIONS AND SEE IF YOU CAN GET YOUR CONVERSATIONS SWING MORE EASILY BACK AND FORTH.</p>
